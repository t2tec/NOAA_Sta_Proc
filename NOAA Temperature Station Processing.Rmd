###Project Synopsis

According to a report published on January 18, 2017 by the **National Aeronautics and Space Administration** (**NASA**) and the **National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration** (**NOAA**):

> ...(the) Earth's 2016 surface temperatures were the warmest since modern record keeping began in 1880.

> Globally-averaged temperatures in 2016 were 1.78 degrees Fahrenheit (0.99 degrees Celsius) warmer than the mid-20th century mean. This makes 2016 the third year in a row to set a new record for global average surface temperatures.

***

The **2016 Weather Data Exploratory Analysis** project was started to review the raw data from **NOAA** and identify areas of uncertainty and their potential impact on reaching a greater than 95% scientific certainty.

This is **Part 1** of the **2016 Weather Data Exploratory Analysis**. 

###Stations Data

The data will be coming from the **NOAA** FTP site at the following links:

+ ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/

The specific files we will be using are:

+ ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/ghcnd-countries.txt
+ ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/ghcnd-inventory.txt
+ ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/ghcnd-stations.txt
+ ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/ghcnd-states.txt

The files are in a text format with specific layouts which are defined in the `readme.txt` file located at the following:

+ ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/readme.txt

The specific instructions for each file will be documented in *Appendix A: Station Files* and will come from the `readme.txt` file to make it clear how and why the file is being processed in a particular manner.

The master lists will consist of observation stations that collect temperature data, their respective geographic coordinates, country, state and location information, and years of operation. Three master lists will be created for use in future exploratory analysis and saved in `.Rds` format:

+ `master_stations_ww.rds`
+ `master_stations_us50.rds`
+ `master_stations_us48.rds`

**Libraries Required**
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)          # Data manipulation
library(knitr)          # Dynamic report generation
library(readr)          # Reading tabular data
library(stringi)        # String processing
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
setwd("~/NOAA Projects/NOAA Station Processing")
```
  
***

####Read Station Files

All of the station files are `Fixed Width Format` text files so the `read_fwf` function from the `readr` package will be used.

Within each code chunk the file will be read using the beginning and ending positions of the variables defined, column names will be assigned, and any preliminary processing will be performed. This includes converting data to uppercase or selecting only the variables needed for the master lists. In some cases, needed variables exist in multiple files (`Latitude`, `Longitude`). Redundant variables will be removed from the latter data tables as part of the preliminary processing.

A brief view of the data will follow each processing step for clarification purposes.

kable(head(ghcnd_states, 5))
```

### Process Stations Data

The project is focused on worldwide temperature data. Observation stations in the **NOAA** inventory record many different observation types, `Elements`, but this project is concerned with the `TAVG`, `TMAX`, and `TMIN` observations.

**Set Element Vector**
```{r}
temp_elements <- c("TAVG",
                   "TMAX",
                   "TMIN")
```

The `inventory` file is structured to have multiple entries for each observation station if they record more than one type of observation. The master list will contain a single entry for each station that meets the criteria of recording any of the values in the `temp_elements` vector.

The `dplyr` package will be used to filter, group, and reduce the entries to a single observation. Upon completion, the `Element` variable will be removed from the table since it will no longer be used. The final instruction will create a two character country code using the first two characters of the station `ID`. This variable will be used to join the data from the `countries` data.

**Process Inventory Data**
```{r}
ghcnd_inventory <- ghcnd_inventory %>%
                   filter(Element %in% temp_elements) %>%      ## Filter for temperature values
                   group_by(ID) %>%                            ## Group data by ID
                   slice(1L) %>%                               ## Reduce entries to a single observation
                   ungroup() %>%
                   select(-Element) %>%                        ## Remove the Element variable
                   mutate(CCode = substr(ID,1,2))              ## Create country code from ID

kable(head(ghcnd_inventory, 5))
```

The `countries` data will be joined with the `inventory` data by the variable `CCode` using `dplyr`. Once complete, the `CCode` can be removed and `ghcnd_countries` can be removed from the working environment. 

**Join Countries Data to Inventory Data**
```{r}
ghcnd_inventory <- left_join(ghcnd_inventory, ghcnd_countries, by = "CCode") %>%
                   select(-CCode)

rm(ghcnd_countries)

kable(head(ghcnd_inventory, 5))
```

The `stations` data can be joined to the `inventory` data using the variable `ID`. Once complete, `ghcnd_stations` can be removed from the working environment.

**Join Stations Data to Inventory Data**
```{r}
ghcnd_inventory <- left_join(ghcnd_inventory, ghcnd_stations, by = "ID")

rm(ghcnd_stations)

kable(head(ghcnd_inventory, 5))
```

The final step in the station processing is to join the `states` data with the `inventory` data using the variable `SCode`. Once compete, the table will be reorganized to make viewing cleaner and `ghcnd_states` can be removed from the working environment.

**Join States Data to Inventory Data**
```{r}
ghcnd_inventory <- left_join(ghcnd_inventory, ghcnd_states, by = "SCode") %>%
                   select(ID, Latitude, Longitude, Elevation, Country,
                          State, Location, FirstYear, LastYear)

rm(ghcnd_states)

kable(head(ghcnd_inventory, 5))
```

***

#### Clean Inventory Data Elevation Values

The recorded elevation is set to -999.9 for stations with missing values.

**Check For Missing Elevations**
```{r}
nrow(ghcnd_inventory %>%
     filter(Elevation == -999.9))
```

There are `447` stations with missing `Elevation` recordings. These readings will be converted to `NA` (Not Available). If the value recorded is valid it will be converted from *meters* to *feet*. The conversion factor is `1` meter is equal to `3.28084` feet. 

**Convert Elevations**
```{r}
ghcnd_inventory <- ghcnd_inventory %>%
                   transform(Elevation = ifelse(Elevation == -999.9,
                                                NA,
                                                Elevation * 3.28084))

summary(ghcnd_inventory$Elevation)
```

The maximum and minimum elevation levels are within the known ranges of the highest and lowest points on Earth.

***

### Save Master Stations Data

The worlwide master list is complete and can now be saved.

**Save Master Worldwide Station List**
```{r,echo=FALSE}
saveRDS(ghcnd_inventory, "C:/Users/tterry/Documents/NOAA Data/Temp Stations/master_stations_ww.rds")
```

```{r,eval=FALSE}
saveRDS(ghcnd_inventory, "~/Temp Stations/master_stations_ww.rds")
```

***
  
To create the master lists for the 50 United States and 48 Contiguous Unites States the `ghcnd_inventory` file will need to be filtered. The first check to make is the number of states that are recorded as part of the U.s. 

**Check U.S. States**
```{r}
temp_us <- ghcnd_inventory %>%
           filter(Country == "UNITED STATES")

table(temp_us$State)

rm(temp_us)
```


There are three "states" that can be removed from the data for the purposes of the future uses of the U.s. master lists.


**Create U.S. 50 Master List**
```{r}
rem_states <- c("DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA", "PACIFIC ISLANDS", "U.S. MINOR OUTLYING ISLANDS")

ghcnd_inventory <- ghcnd_inventory %>%
                   filter(Country == "UNITED STATES") %>%
                   filter(!State %in% rem_states)
```

**Save U.S. 50 Master List**
```{r,echo=FALSE}
saveRDS(ghcnd_inventory, "C:/Users/tterry/Documents/NOAA Data/Temp Stations/master_stations_us50.rds")
```

```{r,eval=FALSE}
saveRDS(ghcnd_inventory, "~/Temp Stations/master_stations_us50.rds")
```

***

The master list for the 48 Contiguous United States requires Alaska and Hawaii being removed.

**Create U.S. 48 Master List**
```{r}
rem_states <- c("ALASKA", "HAWAII")

ghcnd_inventory <- ghcnd_inventory %>%
                   filter(!State %in% rem_states)
```

**Save U.S. 48 Master List**
```{r,echo=FALSE}
saveRDS(ghcnd_inventory, "C:/Users/tterry/Documents/NOAA Data/Temp Stations/master_stations_us48.rds")
```

```{r,eval=FALSE}
saveRDS(ghcnd_inventory, "~/Temp Stations/master_stations_us48.rds")
```

***

**Clean Working Environment**
```{r}
rm(ghcnd_inventory)
rm(inputFile, rem_states, temp_elements)
```

***

### Next Steps

Using the master observation lists created in this project, a data exploration and analysis will be performed to review station densities and distributions around the world. 

In **Part 2**, the focus will be on Hemispheric, Quadrant, and country diversity along with land mass comparisons for density.

In **Part 3**, the focus will be on the stations present during the Mid-Century baseline years (1951-1980) compared to 2016. 

In **Part 4**, a review of the methodology that **NOAA** uses to aggregate data across geographic sectors will be performed.
